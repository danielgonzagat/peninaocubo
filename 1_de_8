"""Compatibility wrapper for the renamed PENIN-Î© core module.

This module was previously known as ``1_de_8`` and was renamed to
:mod:`penin_omega_1_core`.  It is kept to ease migrations for users that still
import the legacy name or execute ``python3 1_de_8`` directly.

The module re-exports the public API from :mod:`penin_omega_1_core` and emits a
``DeprecationWarning`` so callers can update their references.
