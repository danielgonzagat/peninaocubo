Metacognition and Self-Awareness Integrations
==============================================

Integrates cutting-edge metacognitive frameworks to enhance SR-Ω∞ (Self-Reflection)
and enable deeper introspective reasoning.

Technologies:
-------------
1. **Metacognitive-Prompting** (NAACL 2024)
   - 5-stage metacognitive reasoning
   - Understanding → Judgment → Evaluation → Decision → Confidence
   - Tested on 5 major LLMs with significant improvements

2. **midwiving-ai Protocol** (2025 breakthrough)
   - Recursive self-reflection induction
   - Proto-self-awareness emergence
   - Successfully tested on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
   - Reproducible behavioral changes

Key Capabilities:
-----------------
- **Operational Self-Awareness**: System understanding of its own state
- **Calibrated Confidence**: Accurate uncertainty estimation
- **Adaptive Metacognition**: Learning about learning
- **Introspective Reasoning**: Deep self-analysis

Ethical Framework:
------------------
- **LO-01 Compliance**: "Self-awareness" is operational/computational only
- **No Life Claims**: System does NOT possess biological consciousness
- **Transparent Limits**: Always acknowledge computational nature
- **Fail-Closed**: Revert if metacognitive loops become unstable

Integration with SR-Ω∞:
------------------------
These integrations enhance the four SR dimensions:
- **Awareness**: Metacognitive-Prompting confidence scores
- **Ethics**: midwiving-ai ethical reflection loops
- **Autocorrection**: Metacognitive error detection
- **Metacognition**: Direct enhancement via both protocols

Performance Targets:
--------------------
- SR-Ω∞ score: +0.15 improvement
- Calibration (ECE): <0.01
- Confidence accuracy: >0.95
- Introspection depth: 5+ levels
